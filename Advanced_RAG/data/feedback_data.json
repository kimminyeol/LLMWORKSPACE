{"query": "What is the greenhouse effect?", "response": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process where greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun. These gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), allow sunlight to enter the atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface. When the Earth's surface absorbs this sunlight, it emits heat in the form of infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases absorb and re-radiate some of this heat, preventing it from escaping back into space, thus warming the planet. This effect is essential for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.", "relevance": 5, "quality": 5, "comments": ""}
